sleep-scoring
#################

Sleep is a flexible opensource graphical user interface for visualization, analysis and scoring of polysomnographic sleep data. 
It was orginally developed by Etienne Combrisson in collaboration with Raphael Vallat and Christian O Reilly. 
This standalone version was devleoped by Anjo Pagdanganan under the guidance of Omer Sharon at the Center for Human Sleep Sciene at UC Berkeley in order to allow direct install in a contemporary python environment.
It also include some bug fixes and new features such as: 1) # 2) # 3) #.

SCREENSHOT

A copy of the relevant documentation is provided `in this repo <https://github.com/x64-bit/sleep-scoring/blob/main/docs/sleep.rst>`_, but can also be found at the `original Visbrain repo <https://github.com/EtienneCmb/visbrain/blob/master/docs/sleep.rst>`_.

Example code can be found under `examples/gui_sleep <https://github.com/x64-bit/sleep-scoring/tree/main/examples/gui_sleep>`_

Installation
=================

It is recommended to install this in a virtual environment using conda. This package was developed on Python 3.12 but has been shown to work with Python >= 3.9.::

    python -m pip install sleep-scoring 

It is recommended to preface `pip` with `python -m` to ensure it uses the virtual environment's installation of python*

Start scoring
=================

Sleep can be deployed using this python script (see `examples/basic_sleep.py`)::

    from sleep_scoring.gui import Sleep

    Sleep().show()


You can either start Python in the terminal with the `python` command and write the commands there, or you can create a python script and run it.
